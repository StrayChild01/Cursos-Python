    "# Jupyter Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is an environment for combining interactive coding and text in a webbrowser. This allows us to easily share code as well as narrative around that code. An example that was popular in the scientific community was [the discovery of gravitational waves.](https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The name Jupyter is a rebranding of an open source project previously known as iPython Notebook. The rebranding was to emphasize that although the backend is written in Python, it supports various *kernals* to run other languages, including Julia (the \"Ju\" portion), Python (\"pyt\"), and R (\"er\"). All popular *data science* programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of Jupyter includes a server running various kernals. Using a *notebook* we can interact with a kernal. Typically we use a webbrowser to do this, but there are other iterfaces, such as an emacs mode (ein).\n",

    "    \n",
    "You will notice that unlike a normal Python REPL, this will note print anything after hitting return again. To *execute* the cell, you need to hold down control and hit enter (``C-Enter``). This will run the code, print the results of the cell and put you back into edit mode.     \n",
